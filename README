CONTENTS:

The package contains the following MATLAB functions:

standardizeImage.m
        Rescale an image to a standard size.

computeFeatures.m
        Compute dense SIFT keypoints and descriptors.

quantizeDescriptors.m
        Qquantize visual descriptors into visual words.

computeHistogram.m
        Compute a spatial histogram of visual words (starting from the
        features).

removeSpatialInformation
        Reduce a spatial histogram to a simple one.

computeHistogramFromImage.m
        Compute a histogram of visual words (starting from an image).

computeHistogramsFromImageList.m
        Applies computeHistogramFromImage to a list of images.

learnLinaerSVM.m
        Learn a linear support vector machine.

visualizeRankedImagelist
        Visulaize a subset of a ranked list of images.

Demo scripts:

experiment1.m -- learns and test an image classifier
experiment2.m -- shows the effect of the training set size on performance
experiment3.m -- shows the spatial pyramid and normalization on the performance
experiment4.m -- shows the effect of the square root kernel on the performance
experiment5.m -- displays informative visual words

APPENDX (INSTALLATION):

Run MATLAB and execute the command PREPROCESS(). This will download
the VLFeat library (http://www.vlfeat.org) and the Caltech-4 image
collection. Then, it will compute a visual vocabulary and spatial
histograms of visual words for the Caltech-4 images.
